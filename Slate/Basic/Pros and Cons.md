# Pros
- Can be used for both runtime and unreal tools
	- IE can be used to extend editor, as the editor uses slate
- Can be used outside the engine

# Cons
- No Visual Designer
	- There are ways around this by using wireframe designers or using UMG to design and then implement into slate
- Animations are hard coded


# Both pro and con
- No blueprints, only C++
	- More performant
	- longer iteration and debugging times
	- Adds extra complexity
- No reflection and garbage collection
